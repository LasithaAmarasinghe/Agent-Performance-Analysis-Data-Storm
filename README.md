# Agent Performance Analysis

A full-stack web application for analyzing and predicting insurance agent performance using machine learning algorithms and interactive data visualizations.

## 📝 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Selected relevant performance features such as new policy count, net income, conversion rates, and others.
   - Normalized the data to ensure uniformity and scalability, preparing it for machine learning models.

2. **K-means Clustering:**  
   - Applied K-means clustering to categorize agents into performance levels (High, Medium, Low) based on their individual performance metrics.

3. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Analysis:**  
   - Performed PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, improving computational efficiency.
   - Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) that contributed the most to clustering, facilitating better decision-making.

4. **Cluster Ranking:**  
   - Calculated composite scores for each cluster by assigning weighted importance to key performance features.
   - Ranked the agents by their performance level (High, Medium, Low) based on the cluster scores.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Agent Performance Predictions:**  
   Predict the performance level of agents based on the latest data.

- **Interactive Data Visualizations:**  
   Dynamic and interactive charts displaying agent performance trends, conversion rates, and other key metrics.

- **Performance Distribution Analysis:**  
   Visualize and analyze the distribution of agents across different performance levels (High, Medium, Low).

- **Modern, Responsive UI:**  
   A sleek and user-friendly interface built using Material-UI, designed for both desktop and mobile devices.

- **RESTful API Backend:**  
   A Python-based backend using FastAPI to handle requests and serve predictions.
